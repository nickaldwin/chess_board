# chess_board

a simple chess board
- In this example, an HTML <div> element with the class "chessboard" is used to represent the chessboard. The JavaScript code is placed within the <script> tags, and it generates the chessboard pattern dynamically by modifying the inner HTML of the "chessboard" element. The CSS styles define the appearance of the chessboard, with alternating light and dark cells.

You can save this code in an HTML file, open it in a web browser, and you'll see a chessboard rendered based on the generated pattern.

- In this program, the generateChessboard function takes the size parameter as the width and height of the chessboard. It uses nested loops to iterate over each position in the grid. If the sum of the row and column indices is even, it adds a space character to the chessboard string; otherwise, it adds a "#" character. After completing each row, a newline character (\n) is added to move to the next line.

You can change the size variable to any positive integer to generate a chessboard of the desired width and height.
